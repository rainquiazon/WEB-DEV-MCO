      <p>"I’m someone who doesn’t usually rely on anyone and I’m not the best at communicating. Some might think I’m lazy, but I’m just quietly observing the world around me, thinking things through, and doing my own thing. I’m extremely addicted to gadgets, I don’t play physical sports, and I’m basically one of the most normal guys in school. I like to keep a mix of curiosity, cleverness, and realism in how I see life, navigating my own world in my own way.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="hobby-right">
          <p> 
            Watching anime has always been more than just a pastime for me; it’s an experience that brings a sense of ease and excitement unlike anything in real life. I often see pieces of myself in certain characters—their emotions, their personality, their struggles. Anime connects deeply with my heart. Among my favorites are My Love for Yamada-kun at Level 999, Oregairu (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU), and Hyouka, with Oregairu having the most profound impact on my perspective and life. Each story resonates with me in a way that feels almost personal, like stepping into another world that mirrors my own emotions.

        </div>
        <div class="hobby-right">
          <p> 
            I enjoy playing story-driven games because, for me, they are more than just entertainment; they are a temporary escape from reality. When I step into the shoes of the main character, it feels like I’m living another version of myself, experiencing their struggles, joys, and triumphs firsthand. Every choice, every success, and every setback resonates with me emotionally, as if their journey is my own. Sometimes I wish the roles were reversed. Reality itself could feel like a game, and the games we play were the true world. That way, life would feel more adventurous, immersive, and full of possibilities. Some of my favorite games include Red Dead Redemption 2, The Last of Us Part I & II, Elden Ring, Resident Evil 4, the Uncharted series, and many more.

        </div>
        <div class="hobby-right">
          <p>
            I often listen to sad music because it lets me explore the depths of my own emotions. It gives me a quiet space to reflect, to feel, and sometimes to understand myself better. I feel like, somewhere out there, someone also feels what I feel and knows how to express it. There’s a strange comfort in letting the melodies carry my thoughts, almost like walking through my own story while the music narrates it. Sad music isn’t just music to me; it’s a companion that helps me process life and understand my emotions better.

        </div>
        <div class="hobby-right">
          <p>  
            My standout skill in gaming is perfect dodging, a precision ability I’ve honed across multiple challenging action RPGs. In Elden Ring, I can flawlessly evade Malenia’s Waterfowl attacks, reading her timing and movement to avoid even the most punishing combos. This skill carries over to other games like Dark Souls and Black Myth: Wukong, where I consistently dodge complex enemy patterns with split-second timing, allowing me to maintain offensive pressure while staying unharmed. Mastering this skill requires patience, focus, and an intimate understanding of enemy behavior, making it one of my most reliable and impressive abilities in combat gameplay.
